  ## Installation

  ~~***This project is hosted on a heroku eco-dyno, when it is not being actively used it requires a bit extra start up time. This can be mitigated by upgrading to the next tier on heroku.***~~

  HardHat Deployment

  Included is hardhat folder for deploying contract to the different testnets: run `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network *networkname*` to deploy to the network that was declared in the setting file.

  Once ompelted, we would require these addresses to call the contract from our server.

  For documentation purposes, here are the deployed contract address for the following testnets:
  > Eth-sepolia: 0xB3A2bF2c143970c10618ED8E4007b68D55e63eb0 / 0xE61DD73008A3c66fBF9A9f7c5785f2B68139475d
  > Poly-amoy: 0xB13a80d106f97669D53E64004DC4507c8D2C02BD / 0xB134BB71d6DE99dB9C18F87f61bD7313b20670F6
  > Arbitrum: 0xD830Bf02536F8F7c22E359A6d775219F52374FE9 / 0xa51c0FB50104Ac305Ed394974eb9bfAD0f9F66e7
  > Base: 0xfE45f33b94953D779De8CB97D87f4e700f7684aC / 0xfda7803d2c773d755F96CB14685aCcB34b85ed87

  This simple smart contract is written in solidity and simply emit an event for our server to listen to.
