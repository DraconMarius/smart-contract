  ## Description
  **This project features fullstack app meant to measure the latency for calling a simple contract that emit an event which will be listened by our server. Then using the emited time to calculate our latencies writing to the network as well as reading from the contract. The data is then stored in JawsDB and displayed in react with dynamic heights and color.**

  ## Installation

  ~~***This project is hosted on a heroku eco-dyno, when it is not being actively used it requires a bit extra start up time. This can be mitigated by upgrading to the next tier on heroku.***~~
  
  [Deployed Heroku Link](https://smart-contract-latency-2881eb8bf0c3.herokuapp.com/)

  HardHat Deployment

  Included is hardhat folder for deploying contract to the different testnets:
  
  After `npm install` within this hardhat folder you can run `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network *networkname*` to deploy to the network that was declared in the setting file.

  Once compelted, we would require manually setting these deployed addresses to call the contract from our server.

  For documentation purposes, here are the current deployed contract address for the following testnets:
  > Eth-sepolia: 0xA1284BF0e4326C2e1AA597EadDc9f081A76Dfa48 | https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/

  > Poly-amoy: 0xf77CC6fc2df2Ea00deE9bf4cFf26DE673B299b03 | https://polygon-amoy.g.alchemy.com/v2/
  
  > Arbitrum:  0xB134BB71d6DE99dB9C18F87f61bD7313b20670F6 | https://arb-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/
  
  > Base: 0x1B0FD62516d4C71E722E2e695D14cc024bD9F3b3 | https://base-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/

  *Please see [Snippets](#snippets) for a breakdown of the contract.*

  If you would like to host a local version of it yourself, please follow these instructions:

  > ensure your `env` file is set up with 
  > - `DB_NAME`
  > - `DB_PASSWORD`
  > - `DB_USER`
  > - `SECRET`(db secret phrase)
  > - `ALCHEMY_API_KEY`(since we are using the Alchemy RPCs)
  > - `SECRET_KEY`(the wallet we want to use to interact with our contract).

  > to install both the client and server side dependencies: `npm run install` at the project root folder

  > navigate to your SQL CLI, initiate/reset our db instance: `mysql -u -root -p` | `source smart-contract/server/db/schema.sql`

  > start the server to sync our table: `npm start`

  > adding initial network seed data: `npm run seed`

  > to concurrently start server and client react code w/ hotreload: `npm run develop`

  ## Snippets
  > **To call our smart contract, we need the Contract ABI artifact generated by our hardhat, and config,so ether.js can help us set up our listeners and interactivity**

  > **Listener set up**

  > ![snip3](/client/src/assets/listener.png)
  >
  > we then set up a cron schedule to call our contract every 30 minutes

  > **Read Latencies after event**
  >
  > once the `checkLatnecy` function has been called, the current block time that the call was mined will be saved by our contract for our read latencies
  >
  > ![snip7](/client/src/assets/write.png)
  >
  > and once we received the called event on our server end, it will initiate a second call for the `readLatency` function that retreive the calculated latencies between the original write block as our `startTime` for our read latencies, and calculate the difference between the stored time vs the current block time.
